Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses and food insecurity. To address this challenge, this project presents a Python-based system for detecting plant diseases through traditional image processing techniques. The system analyzes digital images of plant leaves to identify visible symptoms such as discoloration, spots, and patterns indicative of infection. Key Python libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy are used for tasks including image preprocessing, color space conversion, segmentation, and feature extraction. Based on these extracted features, simple rule-based logic or thresholding methods are applied to classify the presence or absence of disease. This approach offers a cost-effective and accessible solution for early-stage disease detection, especially in rural or resource-limited environments. The project aims to support farmers and agricultural workers in monitoring plant health and taking preventive measures in a timely manner. Teck stack: Python, CSS, HTML. Software: Spyder.
